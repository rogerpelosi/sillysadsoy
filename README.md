Complex relationalities have helped to shape that which I choose to embody, and have allowed me to flourish thus far. I wish to cultivate my current relationships and open up to new ones, exposing myself and others to more love. This conscious intimacy and vulnerability brings me new perspective every day. 

Looking forward, I hope to work with unique individuals in a professional setting, to continue connecting with peers, ultimately gaining invaluable work/life experience and settling into a role within an organization. 

Personal achievements I would like to accomplish include publishing a play, displaying my multimedia-multidimensional artwork, and working on digital programs that facilitate community building and outreach. 

Lastly, I intend to continuously observe mindful praxis in all that I do, to further develop my relationships with myself and the worlds around me, thanks for connecting!
